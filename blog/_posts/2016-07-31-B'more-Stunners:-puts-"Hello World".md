#B'More Stunners: Puts “Hello World!”
---

###Ready, Set, Go!

We are Ashley and Ore of team B’More Stunners!! We first met at our city’s local Rails Meetup and we instantly clicked. After both coaching a Rails Workshop for Women this past February, we decided to take the plunge and apply for the RGSoC fellowship(Ore was very convincing.) Through our various connections within the tech community, we were able to assemble a team of awesome coaches to help us this summer!

We could not have gotten this far without the support of our beloved coaches, mentors, supervisors and the community!

###Who are we? 

*Ashley* -  Born and raised in New York, but happy to have called Baltimore home for the past six years! Last year, I attended a Rails Workshop where I was introduced to Ruby on Rails.  It’s safe to say I quickly became fascinated by the power of code and I eagerly wanted to learn more. So, for the past year I dedicated myself to learning Ruby in my spare time. Although it has been quite challenging juggling a full time job and learning to program on nights and weekends, I could not be happier. When I am not writing code, I still find myself lurking for opportunities to get involved within Baltimore's Tech scene. I avidly attended Baltimore’s Rails and Girls Develop It! meetups. My other interest includes, attending my weekly book club with friends, running, and taking naps. Lastly, I enjoy exploring my beautiful city through its eateries, breweries, art galleries and music venues!

*Ore* - I am a staunch advocate of increasing the visibility of women in the technology sector. Through my work with Women Who Code DC and the Baltimore Women in Tech community, Ore has proven her commitment to making the tech sector more inclusive. As a teacher for Code in the Schools, I provides quality computer science instruction to youth in Baltimore City.
Last winter a good friend of mine told me about the Rails Girls Summer of Code fellowship. I was working through ruby koans at the time with my mentor Will Barrett, now an unofficial coach, and he encouraged me to pursue it. The hunt was on.

Starting off on the right foot
This summer we are working alongside the Bundler team to create a public dashboard that will showcase its metrics. This dashboard will provide programmers with information such as "What is the most popular Ruby version, what is least and/or used most bundler version, and etc." With these metrics, the folks at Bundler will not only be able to analyze this data, but also make precise decisions about future version upgrades. We are super excited to be apart of a project that will have a direct impact to the ruby community. As newly developers, we couldn't have dreamed for a better way to jumpstart our careers! (not in love with this sentence, any ideas on how to make it better?)

Struggles and breakthroughs
We had a difficult time figuring out where to start off in the beginning  but talking to our coaches and supervisors really helped us solidify a plan.  With everything that goes on in our lives persevering through it with the belief  that we will make it through is what has kept us going. It helped us push through the application process.


What We've Learned 
Aspects of Agile Mythology for project planning purposes
How to use a Public API and its request to the server
The relationships of clients and servers, specifically within Bundler/RubyGems
Our coaches are the best human beings on Planet Earth.... 


What's Next to Come
Create a new controller and route with Rubygems repository, 
Figure out where/how to display the dashboard
Figure out how to Batch metrics to Librato(analytics) API
Stress Less and continue to have fun! (insert cute emolji)
